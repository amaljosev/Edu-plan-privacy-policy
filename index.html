    <h1>Privacy Policy for EDU PLAN Mobile App</h1>

    <p>Effective Date: 18-01-2024</p>

    <p>Thank you for using the EDU PLAN mobile application, developed by FlutterVerseOfficial ("Amal Jose"). EDU PLAN is
        designed for teachers and students within a specific school, and this Privacy Policy outlines how your data is
        collected, used, and protected. By using the App, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>1. About App:</h2>

    <p>
        This app is designed exclusively for school use and is not intended for general users. Only those with
        authorized access can log in to the app. If someone downloads the app and signs up, their data will be
        temporarily stored in the database, but it will be removed permanently by the admin. Initially, the data is
        stored, but only the school admin has the ability to view and control it. For inquiries or to connect with the
        school admin, please refer to the contact information provided below.</p>



    <h2>2. Information We Collect:</h2>

    <p><strong>2.1 Teachers Data:</strong><br>
        The app only collects the teacher's name, email, password, and contact number during the sign-up process.
        However, this information is treated as a request, and it is not stored permanently in the database if the
        individual is not a teacher at that particular school. The data is sent to the admin as a request, and if the
        admin verifies that the individual is a teacher and accepts the request, only then is the data stored in the
        database. Otherwise, if the admin rejects the request, the data will be cleared.
    </p>
    <p><strong>2.2 Students Data:</strong><br>
        Students or any other users do not directly provide any details to the app; they can only log in if they are a
        student. Personal details and credit information for students are already provided to the school administration,
        and they have the authority to use this data. The administration, in turn, is responsible for providing the data
        to teachers. Teachers are tasked with creating accounts for students and generating passwords. As a result,
        students or any other users cannot log in without the corresponding email and password. Students directly
        provide their email to teachers, ensuring that teachers are aware of the student and that the school possesses
        their data. Teachers are responsible for creating and distributing passwords to students to prevent unauthorized
        access to the app.</p>
    <p><strong>2.3 School Administration Data:</strong><br>
        The App does not collect data related to the school administration, such as the name and contact details of the
        school principal or head of the school.They have only the control of the app. This is only for educational
        purposes.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Control:</h2>

        school principal or head of the school. They only have control over the app, and it is intended solely for
        educational purposes. </p>

    <p><strong>3.2 Developer Access:</strong><br>
        The Developer, FlutterVerseOfficial, does not have access to the user data collected by the App. All data is
        solely controlled and managed by the school administrator.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Usage:</h2>

        functionalities.</p>

    <p><strong>4.2 No Data Sharing:</strong><br>
        The App does not share user data with any external third parties, including the Developer. The data is strictly
