    <h1>Privacy Policy for EDU PLAN Mobile App</h1>

    <p>Effective Date: 18-01-2024</p>

    <p>Thank you for using the EDU PLAN mobile application, developed by FlutterVerseOfficial ("Amal Jose"). EDU PLAN is
        designed for teachers and students within a specific school, and this Privacy Policy outlines how your data is
        collected, used, and protected. By using the App, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>1. About App:</h2>

    <p>
        This is not an app for common users. This is only for a school not for everyone so If you donâ€™t have access you
        cant login the app. So if anyone downloads the app and signs up the data not stored on the database permanently
        it will be removed by the admin but it stores first but the data can view and control the school admin only. If
        you want to connect the school admin it's given below the contact section.</p>



    <h2>2. Information We Collect:</h2>

    <p><strong>2.1 Teachers Data:</strong><br>
        The app only collects the teacher's name, email, password and contact number on sign up, it's just a request but
        the data is not stored permanently on the database if you are not a teacher in that school. The data goes as a
        request to the admin and if the admin verifies this is a teacher and accepts the request then only the data
        stored on the database else admin rejects the request means the data will clear.
    </p>
    <p><strong>2.2 Students Data:</strong><br>
        Students or any other users are not providing any details directly to the app,they can only login if you are a
        student. Students personal details and credit details are already then given to the school administration and
        they have the authority to use the data. The authority is giving the data to teachers. They create the accounts
        for students and the password also ,so students or any other user can't login without the email and password.
        Students give email directly to teachers so they know the teacher and the school have their data. Teachers
        create and give the password to students so others can't use the app.</p>
    <p><strong>2.3 School Administration Data:</strong><br>
        The App does not collect data related to the school administration, such as the name and contact details of the
        school principal or head of the school.They have only the control of the app. This is only for educational
        purposes.</p>
